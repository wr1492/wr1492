# Hello 👋

<img src="005.jpg" alt="Description of image" width=200px align="left">

I'm a **self-taught programmer** with a passion for **automation** and **data analytics**. I started my programming journey with **Python**, and then I learned some **C** through the [Harvard CS50 course]. I've used my skills to create **machine learning models** and perform **data analysis** with the help of sites like [Kaggle], where you can find some of my notebooks and datasets.

I also have experience with **Arduino** and **ESP32** microcontroller programming, so I've moved into learning **C++** for the microcontrollers. I've completed several projects such as a **pen-plotter**, an **obstacle avoiding robot**, and more. You can see some of my code and videos on my [YouTube channel]. I'm mostly a beginner to intermediate level programmer, but I'm looking to start on some bigger and more advanced projects that I would like to share.

I'm particularly interested in applying my skills in a **professional setting**, and I'm currently seeking **opportunities** in programming automation or data analytics. I'm also interested in **open source** and making my projects open and contributing to other open source projects. I'm always looking for more ways to get involved.

Feel free to explore my portfolio to see some of the projects I've worked on.

## Skills 🛠️

- Python programming:Python syntax, data structures, functions, and libraries. Python for data analysis. 
- Machine learning: fundamentals of data science and machine learning, such as data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model selection, training, evaluation, and deployment. I have also learned how to use popular Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow for machine learning tasks.
